## Hi there, I'm Navraj Kalsi :wave:

:computer: I started my coding journey at 16, and after 4 years of honing my skills, I've built a strong foundation across several technologies. Here's a quick overview:
- Python was my first language (no surprises there!). After mastering the basics, I explored front-end development with HTML & CSS.
- JavaScript unlocked the power of the DOM and introduced me to dynamic web development. I also ventured into working with databases.
- Recently, I've been focusing on backend development, where I'm really hitting my stride.

:mortar_board: While studying programming at Sheridan College, I developed a passion for cloud technologies:
- **AWS:** For its granular control and vast capabilities.
- **FireBase:** For its efficiency and speed in deployment.

:dart: I'm actively seeking a **backend developer role**, preferably working with Python.

:mailbox_with_mail: If you're hiring for a similar position, feel free to [reach out](mailto:navrajkalsi@icloud.com) - I'd love to chat!

Thanks for stopping by my profile! Let's build something amazing together :rocket:



:computer: I started learning to code when I was 16 years old, so I have been coding for 4 years now.
My first language was Python (shocker!), after learning the basics I juggled with some front end with basic HTML & CSS.
Then JavaScript to play with the DOM along with some database.
Currently I have been really liking my progress in backend.
During my programming course at Sheridan, I really got into cloud, specifically AWS (for more control) & Firebase (for faster deployment).

Currently, I am looking for a backend position, preferably in Python.
