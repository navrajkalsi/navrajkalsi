## Hi there, I'm Navraj Kalsi

I love to **think** & **learn**.

<br>

Currently, I am working on:
- ~~[forexpy](https://github.com/navrajkalsi/forexpy): A command line tool that fetches **live Forex exchange rates**.~~
- ~~[server-c](https://github.com/navrajkalsi/server-c): A lightweight **HTTP server in C**, with HTTPS support.~~
- ~~[portfolio-website](https://github.com/navrajkalsi/portfolio-website): Personal website, served using **[server-c](https://github.com/navrajkalsi/server-c)**.~~
- Figuring out...

<br>

Things about me:
- I use Arch btw.
- I use Neovim btw.
- I love movies and true IMAX.

I'm seeking a **backend developer role** to begin my programming career.

If you're hiring for a similar position, feel free to [reach out](mailto:navrajkalsi@icloud.com) - I'd love to chat!

Thanks for stopping by my profile! Let's build something amazing together.
