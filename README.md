## Hi there, I'm Navraj Kalsi :wave:

:computer: I started my coding journey at 16, and after 4 years of honing my skills, I've built a strong foundation across several technologies. Here's a quick overview:
- Python was my first language (no surprises there!). After mastering the basics, I explored front-end development with HTML & CSS.
- JavaScript unlocked the power of the DOM and introduced me to dynamic web development.
- You could see my front end work here: [navthinks.vip](https://www.navthinks.vip).
- I also ventured into working with databases, with MySQL, MongoDB and Data Integration tools like Talend.
- Recently, I've been focusing on backend development, where I'm really hitting my stride.

:mortar_board: While studying [computer programming](https://www.sheridancollege.ca/programs/computer-programming) at Sheridan College, I developed a passion for cloud technologies:
- **AWS:** For its granular control and vast capabilities. I started my website with an nginx server on an EC2 instance but after a month realized that I did not need to pay for the service, as my trial was coming to an end.
- **FireBase:** For its efficiency and speed in deployment, I personally found it great for SPAs. My site is hosted with firebase at the moment.

:dart: I'm actively seeking a **backend developer role**, preferably working with Python, to begin my programming career.

:mailbox_with_mail: If you're hiring for a similar position, feel free to [reach out](mailto:navrajkalsi@icloud.com) - I'd love to chat!
